# CS8803 Graduate Algorithms

This class focused on building off the algorithms learned at the undergraduate level. We built on graph theory built a bloom filter as our only
project.

## Project 1: Bloom Filter

In this project, we implemented a Bloom filter using variable amounts of hash seeds and one or two hash functions. The goal of a Bloom filter is not to
guarantee that a value has passed through the filter before but to say that a value has "probably" passed through the filter. This is performed by 
hashing a given value multiple times through the same hash function but with differnet has seeds or by using multiple hash functions multiple times with
differnet hash seeds. The results are then recorded using an array of bits and future values look to see if their hash values have already been recorded
in the array. I implemented this design with various amounts of hash seeds and one or two hash functions to analyse the distribution of the hash values
generated by test data, and to evalutate the false positive rates. The scientific report I wrote can be found in the folder "BloomFilterProject" in the 
file named "BloomFilterReport.pdf".
